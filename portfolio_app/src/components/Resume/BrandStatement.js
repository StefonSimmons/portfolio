      <p>
        Iâ€™m a self-motivated creator with over 6 years of experience working within higher education administration as a College Registrar and 15 years as a recording artist. My creativity as an artist and organization as an administrator feed greatly into my passion for software development. Currently, I am seeking to work with people and companies who, like myself, are determined to learn and develop others and their products/services. I consistently contribute strong problem-solving and interpersonal skills as well as an ad/aptive mindset for new processes and technology that may increase productivity.
