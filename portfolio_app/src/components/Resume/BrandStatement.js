      <p>
      Iâ€™m a self-motivated creator with over 7 years of experience working as a higher education professional and 15 years as a recording artist. My creativity as an artist and organization as an administrator feed greatly into my passion for software development. Currently, I am seeking to work with people and companies who, like myself, are determined to learn and develop products/services as well as invest in people. I consistently contribute strong problem-solving and interpersonal skills to my work and rely on my adaptive mindset for designing new processes and technology to production.      </p>
